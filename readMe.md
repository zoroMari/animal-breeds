# Animal breeds :cat: :dog: :mouse:

This is my pet project to practice pure JS for such features: 

:heavy_check_mark: create html elements dynamicaly in runtime by using js 

:heavy_check_mark: create Tabs with different types of information 

:heavy_check_mark: filtering logic 

:heavy_check_mark: work with modals 

:heavy_check_mark: add/remove elements to/from Favorites 

:heavy_check_mark: modify the URL without reloading the page, persist data via URL 

:heavy_check_mark: practice to persist data with localStorage
