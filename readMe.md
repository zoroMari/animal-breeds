# Animal breeds :cat: :dog: :mouse:

This is my pet project to practice pure JS for such features: 

:heavy_check_mark: create html elements dynamicaly in runtime by using js 

:heavy_check_mark: create Tabs for different types of informations 

:heavy_check_mark: create filter 

:heavy_check_mark: create popup 

:heavy_check_mark: add/remove elements to/from Favorites 

:heavy_check_mark: modify the URL without reloading the page 


**And here you will also find many cute photos of cats, dogs and rats and learn about the characteristics of different breeds** :relieved:
