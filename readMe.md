# Animal breeds

This is my pet project to practice pure JS for such feature: 

- create html elements dynamicaly in runtime by js file
- create Tabs for different types of informations
- create filter
- create popup
- add/remove elements to/from Favorites
- modify the URL without reloading the page


**And here you will also find many cute photos of cats, dogs and rats and learn about the characteristics of different breeds**
