    coat: 'medium',
    energy: 'high',
    characteristics: `
      Bengal Cats have an athletic appearance with well-defined muscles, 
      creating a lean, balanced appearance. They feature high cheekbones, dark markings around the eyes 
      and the ears are small and pointed but round at the tips. Their coats have a unique, plush feel 
      unlike any other cat breed.`,
    lifespan: '12 to 16 years',
    colors: `
      One of the most distinctive features of this feline is its unique coat pattern and color.
      Most Bengal Cats’ coats have rich, highly contrasted shades of bright orange to light brown, 
      with dark spots or a distinctive marbling pattern. Some even have a “glitter” to the tips of 
      their fur, which glistens when the light hits it.`,

    coat: 'long',
    energy: 'medium',
    characteristics: `
      The most recognizable characteristics of adult Maine Coon cats are their large size and long, 
      bushy tail. Their paws are big and well-tufted to be suitable for walking in snow, as can be 
      seen in both adult and kitten Maine Coon cats. In addition, their ears are tufted, 
      often with points of hair at the tips.`,
    lifespan: '10 to 13 years',
    colors: `
      The most common color for Maine Coon cats is brown tabby. However, they can be nearly any color 
      and pattern. Their eye colors, too, have a wide range from blue to green to gold, and can 
      include odd-eyes (i.e. two different colored eyes).`,

    mainImg: 'img/cats/siameseCat/siameseCat_main.jpeg',
    size: 'large',
    coat: 'medium',
    energy: 'high',
    characteristics: `
      This highly intelligent feline will seek out things to occupy her mind. So if you don’t want 
      your cat getting into mischief, give her puzzle feeders, games and more to keep her entertained.
      Their point coloring isn’t the only distinguishing feature of Siamese Cats. 
      They also have a distinct, wedge-shaped head with large, triangular ears. 
      The Siamese have a long and slim physique, with longer hind legs and a long, thin tail. 
      Perhaps their most stunning feature is their deep blue eyes, which are almond-shaped and 
      slightly slanted.`,
    lifespan: '11 to 15 years',
    colors: `
      Their distinct coloration makes Siamese Cats easily recognizable. Their point coloring, 
      meaning their ears, feet and tails are darker than their body, can range from brown to chocolate 
      to a blue gray and even lilac. Other point color variations include tabby and other patterns. 
      The body is light in color and usually appears as ivory, cream and even glacial white.`,

    mainImg: 'img/cats/abyssinian/abyssinian_main.jpeg',
    size: 'small',
    coat: 'medium',
    energy: 'high',
    characteristics: `
      Seemingly always in motion, she’ll slow down occasionally to curl up next to you on the couch 
      or in bed. Although independent, she does best with another Aby companion to match her 
      high activity levels while you’re away. Abyssinians love attention from you and respectful 
      children and get along well with cat-friendly dogs, as well as other pets, like large 
      parrots and ferrets.
      The Abyssinian has a wedge-shaped, yet rounded head with broad ears and almond-shaped 
      eyes in shades of gold or green. Her body is muscular and athletic, but slim, and supported 
      by fine-boned legs.`,
    lifespan: '9 to 15 years',
    colors: `
      Abyssinians have what is known as a “ticked” coat, which alternates light and dark bands of 
      color on each hair shaft. The warmth glow of their coat resembles wild cats like cougars. 
      The coat comes in four primary colors: ruddy brown, red, blue and fawn. 
      Some associations permit additional colors, however.`,

      British Shorthairs are round all over, with a broad chest and strong legs.

      British Blues to have gold eyes and those with point coloring to have blue eyes. 
      Other eye colors range from golden to copper.`,
    lifespan: '12 to 17 years',
    colors: `
      Although their coats come in almost every possible color and pattern, the most popular color

    characteristics: `
      The most striking characteristic of the Sphynx is of course her hairlessness, 
      which exposes her warm, chamois like skin for the world to see, touch and enjoy. 
      Her wrinkled skin, exaggerated ears and large eyes give her face an otherworldly expression and wisdom.`,
    lifespan: '8 to 15 years',
    colors: `

      whippetlike body and loves to climb, leap and sprint. With kittenlike antics that last a lifetime, 
      this feline likes to be where the action is. The Cornish Rex is perfect for those who want a cat 
      to participate in their family life.`,
